# Applesauce

Applesauce is a simple endorsement tool for NationStates. It takes a list of nations, and gives you an endorse button to click to your heart's content as you go down the list.

## Installation

Applesauce is an userscript and can be installed [here](applesauce.user.js?raw=1). In order to install and use it, you will need an userscript manager; I use [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/), but others should work as well. To use the script after installation, go to [this page](https://www.nationstates.net/template-overall=none/page=blank/x-applesauce=endo).
